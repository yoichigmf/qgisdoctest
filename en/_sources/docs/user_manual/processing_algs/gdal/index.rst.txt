`GDAL <https://gdal.org>`_ (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a translator
library for raster and vector geospatial data formats. Algorithms in the Processing
Framework are derived from the `GDAL raster programs <https://gdal.org/programs/index.html#raster-programs>`_
and `GDAL vector programs <https://gdal.org/programs/index.html#vector-programs>`_.
