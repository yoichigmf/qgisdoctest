<p>In the previous topics we have taken a closer look at vector data. While vector
features use geometry (points, polylines and polygons) to represent the real
world, raster data takes a different approach. Rasters are made up of a matrix
of pixels (also called cells), each containing a value that represents the
conditions for the area covered by that cell (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-raster"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.2</span></a>). In this topic
we are going to take a closer look at raster data, when it is useful and when it
makes more sense to use vector data.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.2. </span>Raster data in detail<a class="headerlink" href="#raster-data-in-detail" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Raster data is used in a GIS application when we want to display information that
is continuous across an area and cannot easily be divided into vector features.
When we introduced you to vector data we showed you the image in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-landscape"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.3</span></a>.
Point, polyline and polygon features work well for representing some features on
this landscape, such as trees, roads and building footprints. Other features on
a landscape can be more difficult to represent using vector features. For example
the grasslands shown have many variations in colour and density of cover. It
would be easy enough to make a single polygon around each grassland area, but a
lot of the information about the grassland would be lost in the process of
simplifying the features to a single polygon. This is because when you give a
vector feature attribute values, they apply to the whole feature, so vectors
aren’t very good at representing features that are not homogeneous (entirely the
same) all over. Another approach you could take is to digitise every small
variation of grass colour and cover as a separate polygon. The problem with that
approach is that it will take a huge amount of work in order to create a good
vector dataset.</p>

large areas with continuously changing values, raster data can be a better
choice.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this image"></a></p>

<p>Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster data as
a <strong>backdrop</strong> to be used behind vector layers in order to provide more meaning
to the vector information. The human eye is very good at interpreting images and
so using an image behind vector layers, results in maps with a lot more meaning.
Raster data is not only good for images that depict the real world surface (e.g.
satellite images and aerial photographs), they are also good for representing more
abstract ideas. For example, rasters can be used to show rainfall trends over an
area, or to depict the fire risk on a landscape. In these kinds of applications,
each cell in the raster represents a different value e.g. risk of fire on a scale
of one to ten.</p>
<p>An example that shows the difference between an image obtained from a satellite
and one that shows calculated values can be seen in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-raster-types"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.4</span></a>.</p>

<section id="georeferencing">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.3. </span>Georeferencing<a class="headerlink" href="#georeferencing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Georeferencing is the process of defining exactly where on the earth’s surface
an image or raster dataset was created. This positional information is stored
with the digital version of the aerial photo. When the GIS application opens the
photo, it uses the positional information to ensure that the photo appears in the
correct place on the map. Normally this positional information consists of a
coordinate for the top left pixel in the image, the size of each pixel in the X
direction, the size of each pixel in the Y direction, and the amount (if any) by
which the image is rotated. With these few pieces of information, the GIS
application can ensure that raster data are displayed in the correct place. The
georeferencing information for a raster is often provided in a small text file
accompanying the raster.</p>

<section id="sources-of-raster-data">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.4. </span>Sources of raster data<a class="headerlink" href="#sources-of-raster-data" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Raster data can be obtained in a number of ways. Two of the most common ways are
aerial photography and satellite imagery. In aerial photography, an aeroplane
flies over an area with a camera mounted underneath it. The photographs are then
imported into a computer and georeferenced. Satellite imagery is created when
satellites orbiting the earth point special digital cameras towards the earth
and then take an image of the area on earth they are passing over. Once the image
has been taken it is sent back to earth using radio signals to special receiving
stations such as the one shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-csir-station"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.5</span></a>. The process of capturing raster data from
an aeroplane or satellite is called <strong>remote sensing</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>In other cases, raster data can be computed. For example an insurance company may
take police crime incident reports and create a country wide raster map showing
how high the incidence of crime is likely to be in each area. Meteorologists
(people who study weather patterns) might generate a province level raster showing
average temperature, rainfall and wind direction using data collected from weather
stations (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-csir-station"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.5</span></a>). In these cases, they will often use raster
analysis techniques such as interpolation (which we describe in Topic
<a class="reference internal" href="spatial_analysis_interpolation.html#spatial-analysys"><span class="std std-ref">Spatial Analysis (Interpolation)</span></a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes raster data are created from vector data because the data owners want
to share the data in an easy to use format. For example, a company with road,
rail, cadastral and other vector datasets may choose to generate a raster version
of these datasets so that employees can view these datasets in a web browser.
This is normally only useful if the attributes, that users need to be aware of,
can be represented on the map with labels or symbology. If the user needs to look
at the attribute table for the data, providing it in raster format could be a bad
choice because raster layers do not usually have any attribute data associated
with them.</p>

<section id="spatial-resolution">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.5. </span>Spatial Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#spatial-resolution" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Every raster layer in a GIS has pixels (cells) of a fixed size that determine its
spatial resolution. This becomes apparent when you look at an image at a small
scale (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-raster-small-scale"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.6</span></a>) and then zoom in to a large scale (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-raster-large-scale"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.7</span></a>).</p>

<p>Several factors determine the spatial resolution of an image. For remote sensing
data, spatial resolution is usually determined by the capabilities of the sensor
used to take an image. For example SPOT5 satellites can take images where each
pixel is 10 m x 10 m. Other satellites, for example MODIS take images only at
500 m x 500 m per pixel. In aerial photography, pixel sizes of 50 cm x 50 cm are
not uncommon. Images with a pixel size covering a small area are called ‘<strong>high
resolution</strong>’ images because it is possible to make out a high degree of detail
in the image. Images with a pixel size covering a large area are called ‘<strong>low
resolution</strong>’ images because the amount of detail the images show is low.</p>
<p>In raster data that is computed by spatial analysis (such as the rainfall map we
mentioned earlier), the spatial density of information used to create the raster
will usually determine the spatial resolution. For example if you want to create
a high resolution average rainfall map, you would ideally need many weather
stations in close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>One of the main things to be aware of with rasters captured at a high spatial
resolution is storage requirements. Think of a raster that is 3 x 3 pixels, each
of which contains a number representing average rainfall. To store all the
information contained in the raster, you will need to store 9 numbers in the
computer’s memory. Now imagine you want to have a raster layer for the whole of
South Africa with pixels of 1 km x 1 km. South Africa is around 1,219,090 km <sup>2</sup>.
Which means your computer would need to store over a million numbers on its hard
disk in order to hold all of the information. Making the pixel size smaller would
greatly increase the amount of storage needed.</p>
<p>Sometimes using a low spatial resolution is useful when you want to work with a
large area and are not interested in looking at any one area in a lot of detail.
The cloud maps you see on the weather report, are an example of this –– it’s
useful to see the clouds across the whole country. Zooming in to one particular
cloud in high resolution will not tell you very much about the upcoming weather!</p>
<p>On the other hand, using low resolution raster data can be problematic if you are
interested in a small region because you probably won’t be able to make out any
individual features from the image.</p>
</section>
<section id="spectral-resolution">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.6. </span>Spectral resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#spectral-resolution" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you take a colour photograph with a digital camera or camera on a cellphone,
the camera uses electronic sensors to detect red, green and blue light. When the
picture is displayed on a screen or printed out, the red, green and blue (RGB)
information is combined to show you an image that your eyes can interpret. While
the information is still in digital format though, this RGB information is stored
in separate colour <strong>bands</strong>.</p>
<p>Whilst our eyes can only see RGB wavelengths, the electronic sensors in cameras
are able to detect wavelengths that our eyes cannot. Of course in a hand held
camera it probably doesn’t make sense to record information from the <strong>non-visible</strong>
parts of the spectrum since most people just want to look at pictures of their
dog or what have you. Raster images that include data for non-visible parts of
the light spectrum are often referred to as multi-spectral images. In GIS
recording the non-visible parts of the spectrum can be very useful. For example,
measuring infra-red light can be useful in identifying water bodies.</p>
<p>Because having images containing multiple bands of light is so useful in GIS,
raster data are often provided as multi-band images. Each band in the image is
like a separate layer. The GIS will combine three of the bands and show them as
red, green and blue so that the human eye can see them. The number of bands in a
raster image is referred to as its <strong>spectral resolution</strong>.</p>
<p>If an image consists of only one band, it is often called a <strong>grayscale</strong> image.
With grayscale images, you can apply false colouring to make the differences in
values in the pixels more obvious. Images with false colouring applied are often
referred to as <strong>pseudocolour images</strong>.</p>

<section id="raster-to-vector-conversion">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.7. </span>Raster to vector conversion<a class="headerlink" href="#raster-to-vector-conversion" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In our discussion of vector data, we explained that often raster data are used as
a backdrop layer, which is then used as a base from which vector features can be
digitised.</p>
<p>Another approach is to use advanced computer programs to automatically extract
vector features from images. Some features such as roads show in an image as a
sudden change of colour from neighbouring pixels. The computer program looks for
such colour changes and creates vector features as a result. This kind of
functionality is normally only available in very specialised (and often expensive)
GIS software.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.8. </span>Vector to raster conversion<a class="headerlink" href="#vector-to-raster-conversion" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to convert vector data into raster data. One side effect
of this is that attribute data (that is attributes associated with the original
vector data) will be lost when the conversion takes place. Having vectors
converted to raster format can be useful though when you want to give GIS data
to non GIS users. With the simpler raster formats, the person you give the raster
image to can simply view it as an image on their computer without needing any
special GIS software.</p>

<section id="raster-analysis">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.9. </span>Raster analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#raster-analysis" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are a great many analytical tools that can be run on raster data which
cannot be used with vector data. For example, rasters can be used to model water
flow over the land surface. This information can be used to calculate where
watersheds and stream networks exist, based on the terrain.</p>
<p>Raster data are also often used in agriculture and forestry to manage crop
production. For example with a satellite image of a farmer’s lands, you can
identify areas where the plants are growing poorly and then use that information
to apply more fertilizer on the affected areas only. Foresters use raster data
to estimate how much timber can be harvested from an area.</p>
<p>Raster data is also very important for disaster management. Analysis of Digital
Elevation Models (a kind of raster where each pixel contains the height above
sea level) can then be used to identify areas that are likely to be flooded.
This can then be used to target rescue and relief efforts to areas where it is
needed the most.</p>

<p>As we have already mentioned, high resolution raster data can require large
amounts of computer storage.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.11. </span>What have we learned?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-have-we-learned" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Let’s wrap up what we covered in this worksheet:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Raster data are a grid of regularly sized <strong>pixels.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Raster data are good for showing <strong>continually varying information.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The size of pixels in a raster determines its <strong>spatial resolution.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Raster images can contain one or more <strong>bands</strong>, each covering the same spatial
area, but containing different information.</p></li>
<li><p>When raster data contains bands from different parts of the electromagnetic
spectrum, they are called <strong>multi-spectral images</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Three of the bands of a multi-spectral image can be shown in the colours Red,
Green and Blue so that we can see them.</p></li>
<li><p>Images with a single band are called grayscale images.</p></li>
<li><p>Single band, grayscale images can be shown in pseudocolour by the GIS.</p></li>
<li><p>Raster images can consume a large amount of storage space.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.12. </span>Now you try!<a class="headerlink" href="#now-you-try" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Here are some ideas for you to try with your learners:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discuss with your learners in which situations you would use raster data and
in which you would use vector data.</p></li>
<li><p>Get your learners to create a raster map of your school by using A4 transparency
sheets with grid lines drawn on them. Overlay the transparencies onto a
toposheet or aerial photograph of your school. Now let each learner or group
of learners colour in cells that represent a certain type of feature e.g.
building, playground, sports field, trees, footpaths etc. When they are all
finished, overlay all the sheets together and see if it makes a good raster
map representation of your school. Which types of features worked well when
represented as rasters? How did your choice in cell size affect your ability
to represent different feature types?</p></li>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.13. </span>Something to think about<a class="headerlink" href="#something-to-think-about" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you don’t have a computer available, you can understand raster data using pen
and paper. Draw a grid of squares onto a sheet of paper to represent your soccer
field. Fill the grid in with numbers representing values for grass cover on your
soccer field. If a patch is bare give the cell a value of 0. If the patch is
mixed bare and covered, give it a value of 1. If an area is completely covered
with grass, give it a value of 2. Now use pencil crayons to colour the cells
based on their values. Colour cells with value 2 dark green. Value 1 should get
coloured light green, and value 0 coloured in brown. When you finish, you should
have a raster map of your soccer field!</p>
